In optics, dispersion is the phenomenon in which the phase velocity of 
a wave depends on its frequency. Media having this common property may 
be termed dispersive media. Sometimes, the term chromatic dispersion is 
used for specificity. Although the term is used in the field of optics 
to describe light and other electromagnetic waves, dispersion in the same sense 
can apply to any sort of wave motion such as acoustic dispersion
in the case of sound and seismic waves, in gravity waves (ocean waves), and 
for telecommunication signals along transmission lines (such as coaxial cable)
or optical fiber. In optics, one important and familiar consequence of dispersion
is the change in the angle of refraction of different colors of light, as seen in
the spectrum produced by a dispersive prism and in chromatic aberration of lenses.
