A red giant is a luminous giant star of low or intermediate mass
(roughly 0.3-8 solar masses) in a late phase of stellar evolution.
The outer atmosphere is inflated and tenuous,
making the radius large and the surface temperatures around 5,000 K or lower.
The appearance of the red giant is from yellow-orange to red,
including the spectral types K & M, but also class S stars & most carbon stars.
The most common red giants are stars on the red-giant branch that are still
fusing hydrogen into helium in a shell surrounding an inert helium core. 
Other red giants are red-clump stars in the cool half of the horizontal branch,
fusing helium into carbon in their cores via the triple-alpha process;
and the asymptotic-giant-branch (AGB) stars with a helium burning shell
outside a degenerate carbon-oxygen core
and a hydrogen burning shell just beyond that.
