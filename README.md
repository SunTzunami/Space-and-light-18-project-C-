# Space and Light (C++ project '18)
Made this for a school project (used graphics library of C++ 3.0 to make it look kinda cool).
The quiz function uses an interesting point award system (points are awarded based on swiftness in answering- quicker the user response, more points will be awarded, given, the response is correct).
