# Space and Light (C++ project '18)
High school computer science project (used graphics library of C++ 3.0 to make it look kinda cool). I had to code this with Turbo C++ as CBSE mandated it.  

Most OOPs concepts like polymorphism, inheritance and encapsulation were utilised. Data file handling too was used.
I devised an interesting algorithm to award points via the quiz function- points are awarded based on swiftness in answering: quicker the user response, more points will be awarded, provided that the user response is correct. 

# Coded three animations-

# 3.Red Giant-
5 billion years from now, the sun will become a red giant. (will not happen in my lifetime but it still scares the bejesus out of me)
