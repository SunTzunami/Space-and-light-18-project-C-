# Space and Light (C++ project '18)
High school computer science final evaluation project (used graphics library of C++ 3.0 to make it look kinda cool).
Most OOPs concepts like polymorphism, inheritance and encapsulation were utilised. Data file handling too was used.
I devised an interesting algorithm to award points via the quiz function- points are awarded based on swiftness in answering: quicker the user response, more points will be awarded, given, the response is correct.
